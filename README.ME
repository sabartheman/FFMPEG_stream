The version of ffmpeg was installed is ffmpeg-release-armhf-32bit-static

This was done by getting the file from fattylewis.com with the command:

wget https://fattylewis.com/assets/files/arm.tar.gz

Then just unpack make and compile the package to get a relavant version of ffmpeg on the raspberry pi(Wheezy)
